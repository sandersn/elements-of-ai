# elements-of-ai
Example implementations from Elements of Artificial Intelligence by Steven Tanimoto

This book is from 1990. I don't think anybody uses these AI techniques any more but they are attractively simple and fun to implement. This book has lots of Common Lisp examples. I will use Scheme, Javascript or Typescript depending on what I have available at the time.
